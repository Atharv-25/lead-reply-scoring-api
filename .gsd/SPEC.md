# SPEC.md — Project Specification

> **Status**: `FINALIZED`

## Vision
To develop a comprehensive production readiness plan for the Lead Reply Scoring API, ensuring the currently frozen beta codebase can transition to a stable, scalable, and fully operational production environment. This plan will document architecture, identify operational risks, and outline all necessary post-beta tasks without modifying the existing codebase.

## Goals
1. Document the current system architecture and data flows in detail.
2. Identify and evaluate operational risks (e.g., scaling, state management, security).
3. Create a prioritized production readiness plan for post-beta execution.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Modifying the existing beta codebase.
- Adding new features or refining scoring logic.
- Executing the readiness tasks outlined in the plan.
- Refactoring the application structure.

## Users
- Engineering Team (for executing the post-beta plan).
- Product and Operations Teams (for understanding system capabilities and SLA readiness).

## Constraints
- **Technical constraints:** The beta codebase is frozen; all planning must be based on the current implementation state.
- **Process constraints:** Strict adherence to planning-only mode.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation of current architecture and known technical debt.
- [ ] A finalized, prioritized roadmap of tasks required to reach production readiness.
- [ ] Identification and documentation of all major operational risks.
