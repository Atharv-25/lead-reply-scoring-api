# ROADMAP.md

> **Current Phase**: Not started
> **Milestone**: v1.0 (Production Readiness Plan)

## Must-Haves (from SPEC)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation of current architecture and known technical debt.
- [ ] A finalized, prioritized roadmap of tasks required to reach production readiness.
- [ ] Identification and documentation of all major operational risks.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Review
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Deeply analyze the current state of the codebase, explicitly documenting data flow, state persistence models, and latency points to confirm the system architecture mapping.
**Requirements**: REQ-01, REQ-02, REQ-05

### Phase 2: Risk Identification
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Identify operational, security, and scalability risks inherited from the beta implementation. Outline failure scenarios and mitigation strategies.
**Requirements**: REQ-03, REQ-05

### Phase 3: Post-Beta Execution Plan
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Draft the final production readiness plan detailing the specific tasks, sequence of execution, and required infrastructure changes necessary to transition from beta to production.
**Requirements**: REQ-04, REQ-05

### Phase 4: Final Review
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Review the generated documentation and execution plan against the project specification before final delivery.
**Requirements**: REQ-05
